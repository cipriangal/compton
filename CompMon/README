2015 version of Compton Analyzer, courtesy of Gregg Franklin.
This is an "online monitoring" version, and indeed it still
needs work.

  More details about the analyzer are here
      https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3328416

  Details about the data structure are here

Watch out for hard-coded path names in Makefile and scripts.

To compile

  Working in ./CompMon/src

  compile by "make"

Notes about Makefile:   
  A couple things need to be controlled before you can compile.
  EVIO must point to wherever the libevio.so exists. 
  On my private PC, this is
  EVIO 		= /home/rom/evio-4.4/Linux-x86_64/lib

Where is libevio ?   The DAQ group maintains EVIO presently at 
   /site/coda/3.02/src/evio-4.4
More generally /site/coda/CVERS/src/evio-EVERS 
where CVERS = CODA version and EVERS = EVIO version.

To run CompMon

  Working in ./CompMon  To analyzer run 1278

  ./runcompmon.csh 1278

Root files are in ./CompMon/rootfiles
