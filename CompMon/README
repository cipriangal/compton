2015 version of Compton Analyzer, courtesy of Gregg Franklin.
This is an "online monitoring" version, and indeed it still
needs work.

  More details about the analyzer are here
      https://logbooks.jlab.org/entry/3328416

  Details about the data structure are here

Watch out for hard-coded path names in Makefile and scripts.

To compile

  Working in ./CompMon/src

  compile by "make"

Notes about Makefile:   
  A couple things need to be controlled before you can compile.
  EVIO must point to wherever the libevio.so exists. 
  BINDIR must point to wherever you want the binary to be put
  On my private PC, this is
  EVIO 		= /home/rom/evio-4.4/Linux-x86_64/lib
  BINDIR		= /home/rom/testcomp/compton/CompMon/bin

Where is libevio ?   The DAQ group maintains EVIO presently at 
   /site/coda/3.02/src/evio-4.4
More generally /site/coda/CVERS/src/evio-EVERS 
where CVERS = CODA version and EVERS = EVIO version.

To run CompMon

  Working in ./CompMon.  To analyzer run 1278

  ./runcompmon 1278

Root files are in ./CompMon/rootfiles
